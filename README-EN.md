# Learn Computer Science

Here I list the content and curriculum to help you self-study about Computer Science in a standard way. With the development of technology and distribution of quality content from leading universities, self-learners have the opportunity to access this source of knowledge without any cost. This is our lifelong learning opportunity.

 ## Overall Subjects
 
| Subject        | Why Study          |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| Programming    | Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion. |
| Computer Architecture | If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.|
| Algorithms and Data Structures | If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve hard problems.|
| Math for CS | CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage. |
| Operating Systems | Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact. |
| Computer Networking | The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential. |
| Databases | Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work. | 
| Languages and Compilers | If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily. |
| Distributed Systems | These days, most systems are distributed systems. |
